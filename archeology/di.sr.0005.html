Hit and Miss:  A Preliminary Study of Nails at the Beaver Creek Crossing Site (25SW49)</h1>
               <h3>Introduction</h3>
               <p>
This chapter looks at the nails excavated from the Beaver Creek Trail Crossing Site (25SW49), which will be referred to as Beaver Crossing in this chapter from here on.  An attempt will be made to date the site using the manufacturing methods of the nails recovered, to understand the types of buildings present at the site through nail size and probable use, and to advise future excavations looking for the building through the distribution of the nails, as well to look for signs of salvaging activities and how they might have affected the other hypotheses.</p>
               <p>
It should be noted that some archaeologists prefer to use the pennyweight system when discussing nail sizes (example: 2d is a 1&quot; nail); this is the system that is often used to describe nail sizes for commercial purposes. However, for convenience sake I will be referring to nails by inches. Table 5.1 gives the conversions of inches to pennyweights.  Also, because the hypotheses involve the building, machine cut nails will be used almost exclusively in this study as the other categories do not usually involve buildings directly such as shoeing nails from horse or ox shoes.</p>
               <p>
This chapter will begin with a review of the research problem and the literature available on the subject matter, and then continue with an overview of the nails collected at the Beaver Crossing site. Finally, the nails will be analyzed and discussed.</p>
               <h3>Research Problem</h3>
               <p>
Based on evidence from outside sources the nails should be capable of providing us with evidence of the types of buildings present, their location and dates, as well as indicate any salvage activities present.</p>
               <h3>Chronology</h3>
               <p>
Nail chronologies are the most commonly studied aspect of nails.  Jay D. Edwards and Tom Wells (1993) provide one of the best sources of nail chronology.  This book identifies features of nails useful for creating a chronology (nail type, head type, material, side pinched, face pinched, etc.) and outlines things very thoroughly. An article is later released by Tom Wells (1998), which adds to and adjusts some of the topics in this book.</p>
               <p>
Many of the techniques described in these sources require intensive cleaning to view the details of the nail being studied.  The time that would be required to do this is beyond the scope of this study.  However, it is hypothesized that empirical examination of those nail heads that are clean enough to identify will allow for a general date range with the intention of augmenting the historical records and dates gained of other artifact types.</p>
               <p>
It also should be kept in mind that the two main sources for nail chronologies are specific to Louisiana.  It is unknown how Louisiana's nail technology compares to Nebraska's during the time that Beaver Crossing was occupied, although an increased depositional lag would not be unexpected because of Beaver Crossing's frontier location away from nail manufacturing centers.</p>
               <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
               <p>
Ho:  The head types will be too varied or corroded to gain a general date by observing some of the major types of heads.</p>
               <p>
Ha:  A general date can be gained by empirically observing the frequency of the major head types present.</p>
               <h3>Building Type</h3>
               <p>
Based on a count of the types of nails excavated, it should be possible to say whether the building was made primarily of wood, which the documentation suggests, or of some other material that requires fewer nails such as stone, brick, or sod.  A study done by John Walker (1971) gives guidelines about how different sizes of nails are often used in buildings. This is a commonly used source and has been used by other archaeologists in their studies (Stantucci 1981).</p>
               <p>
Katherine Santucci (1981) briefly states that non-frame structures have mostly 2&#189;&quot; to 3&#188;&quot; nails and 4&quot; nails or larger are necessary for structures with wooden frames.  Fred Bischof, on the other hand, uses a more detailed chart (Table 5.2) showing the use of nails from 1&quot; up detailing each common size of cut nail and that the 4&quot; nails are only necessary for heavy framing and that as low as 2&quot; nails can be used for light framing.   I have chosen to follow Bischof, as his information is much more detailed and allows for the use of similar-sized nails for the same purposes.</p>
               <h3>Hypothesis 2</h3>
               <p>
Ho:  The nails at the Beaver Crossing site will not give evidence as to what type of structure(s) was/were present.</p>
               <p>
Ha:  The nails at the Beaver Crossing site will give evidence as to what type of structure(s) was/were present.</p>
               <h3>Building Location</h3>
               <p>
Another goal of this study is to see if the distribution of nails can reveal any clues about the location of a nearby building.  No sources where the distribution of nails was used to specifically locate a building could be found, but a paper written by Kelli Bacon (2001) was used as an example of how to conduct this section of research.</p>
               <h3>Hypothesis 3 </h3>
               <p>
Ho:  The spatial distribution of machine cut nails will not be able to guide future searches for the building.</p>
               <p>
Ha:  The spatial distribution of machine cut nails will be able to guide future searches for the building.</p>
               <h3>Salvaging Activities</h3>
               <p>
Evidence from other parts of the material record at Beaver Crossing suggests that heavy salvaging occurred at the site. This may have affected the conclusions drawn about the building location and building type.  A report of an excavation done by Steven D. Ruple (1986) will be used to give some indication as to what the ratio between non-structural and the possible structural nails should be.  This excavation included nails from three barracks at Fort Randal (Complexes 2, 3 and 6); Complex 2 will not be used due to the later date of its construction, and a significantly higher number of wire nails.  Complex 3 will also not be used because it was moved as an intact unit and this will change the numbers of nails left behind.  The issue that occurs when using this excavation as a comparison to the Beaver Crossing site is that Complex 6 was moved to another location, but was at least partially disassembled first.</p>
               <h3>Hypothesis 4</h3>
               <p>
Ho:  No salvaging activities at the Beaver Creek Crossing site (25SW49) will be visible and the previous hypotheses will not be affected.</p>
               <p>
Ha:  Salvaging activities at the Beaver Creek Crossing site (25WS49) will be visible and will affect the outcome of the previous analysis.</p>
               <h3>The data</h3>
               <p>
The nail count from Beaver Crossing included 960 fasteners of various types. Of this, 905 were machine cut nails and 28 were hand forged; the wire nails, screws, tacks and other categories totaled 27 nails altogether.  Approximately 38 percent of the machine cut nails were bent and 65 percent were fragmented, indicating salvaging activities shown in Table 5.3.</p>
               <p>
The heads that were not too corroded to identify varied quite a lot.  A large portion of the nails were flat headed and ovular with corner tipping being a very common trait. The majority would be described as Type C, although A and B are possible when rust obscures the head.  The heads of larger nails, and fragments that would have been larger nails, very commonly had been augmented with &quot;...embossed domes or squarish raised mounds which do not extend all the way to the edges of the head&quot; and would be Type G heads (Edwards and Wells 1993).</p>
               <p>
Aside from fragmented machine cut nails the most numerous category by far was the 1&#189;&quot; nail at 216 accounting for 68 percent of the unfragmented machine cut nails.  The nails smaller than 1&#189;&quot; (&#190;&quot; to 1&#188;&quot;) totaled 32 nails (10 percent) and larger nails (1&#190;&quot; to 3&#188;&quot;) totaled 71 (22 percent).  The nails, which could possibly be used for framing, consist of 64 (20 percent) of the total non-fragmented machine cut nails.  Of these 15 are 2&quot; nails, 35 are 2&#189;&quot; and 10 are 3&quot;; the others are either not present, or not present in significant numbers. (Table 5.4)</p>
               <p>
Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of machine cut nails across the site. Section 1 contained 0.55 percent of the total machine cut nails excavated (see Table 5.4 and Figure 5.1).  Most activity appears to be occurring in the sections to the north of this one.  Section 3 had the highest number of nails with 46.51 percent of the total machine cut nails, followed by Sections 2 and 4 with 27.69 percent and 21.26 percent.  Section 5 contained a relatively small portion with 3.88 percent of the total machine cut nails.</p>
               <p>
As each of these sections covered a different area, an attempt was made to determine the percent represented by each section per square meter.  Section 3 still had the largest representation per square meter (2.74 percent) which turned out to have a 2.9 times larger representation of machine cut nails than Section 2, 5 times larger than section 4 and 2.6 times larger than Section 5.  Once Units 11 and 12 were treated as outliers in their section the difference increased to Section 3 being 18.3 times larger than Section 2.</p>
               <h3>The analysis</h3>
               <h3>Chronology</h3>
               <p>
The Type B and C heads were not at all helpful in dating the site as these head shapes were common throughout and the eighteenth century and continue to be used.  The Type G head shape does help somewhat as it was most commonly used with the Type 8 nails which were dominant in Louisiana from 1836 to 1885 and this fits the time period of the Beaver Crossing site.</p>
               <h3>Building Type</h3>
               <p>
Nails that possibly could be used for framing (2&quot; and larger) were of 20.06 percent of the machine cut nails, while those that were not structural (.75&quot; to 1.75&quot;) consisted of the remaining 79.04 percent.  While I have no numbers to help analyze this, these numbers do not seem out of line if shingles and lathing were present</p>
               <h3>Building Location</h3>
               <p>
Determining the precise building location will require more excavation; however, the results gained from this analysis can suggest where future excavations should focus their attention.  As far as the nails suggest, it appears that Section 1 is unlikely to reveal much information about the buildings at Beaver Crossing.  The place with the highest concentration of nails is Section 3 (2.74 percent machine cut nails per square meter) suggests that further excavation should take place in that vicinity while Section 5 and maybe Section 4 could also reveal more about the building.  Section 2, other than Units 11 and 12, appears to contain little information pertaining to the building.</p>
               <h3>Salvaging Activities</h3>
               <p>
Ruple (1986) reports that in Complex 6 of the Fort Randall excavation, 20.3 percent of the nails excavated were broken which is not even close to the 61.04 percent fragmented machine cut nails found at the Beaver Crossing site.  The fact that Complex 6 was moved partially intact may explain the difference, and as a result it would appear that Beaver Crossing was heavily salvaged, as other material evidence suggests.</p>
               <p>
Units 11 and 12 have an interesting effect on the analysis as a very isolated high occurrence of nails.  More excavation around them may reveal that they are not as isolated as guessed; however, a number of unique features should be noted.  One issue is the relatively large number of nails that had been exposed to heat.  Unit 11 contains 15 nails that have been exposed to heat, while Feature 12, which was identified as a pit feature (probably a fire pit), has 88 nails bearing a heated context.</p>
               <p>
This may raise the suspicion that the building possibly burned down before it was salvaged; however, the fact that the heated nails are almost exclusively found in these two units suggests that other activities were taking place.  This is bolstered by Ruple's assertion that burning wood would not hold onto the nail as well as a solid piece, although there seems to be no direct evidence to back up this claim.</p>
               <p>
The building was salvaged most likely to reuse the wood, which was valuable on the plains, and this lends itself to a number of suppositions.  When tearing apart a building the larger pieces of wood would be more valuable and more likely to be salvaged.  If this is true, then smaller pieces, and thusly, smaller nails, would be more likely to be left behind which may explain the large number of 1.5&quot; nails.  Also, if larger nails were significantly more valuable than smaller nails then they also might have been collected, which would change the archaeological record.</p>
               <p>
This also raises issues with the second and third hypotheses.  While the evidence suggests a frame and timber building type, the larger nail fragments appeared in significantly greater quantity than the smaller, non-structural, nail fragments.  This difference could possibly be due to the larger nails breaking more easily during salvaging.  Although there is no way of determining the truth of this with this study, future studies might find Ruple's method of measuring the width of nails to determine their original length useful (Ruple 1986).</p>
               <p>
The salvaging also affects the attempts to locate the building through the use of nail spatial patterns.  Had the building been simply abandoned the nails would have been very close to the original location as the structure collapsed over time.  However, because boards were being either removed or discarded, where the nails were found is unlikely to be the location of the building.  While the nails are likely not at the actual location of the building it is unlikely that the boards were moved far before nails were removed.</p>
               <h3>Conclusions</h3>
               <p>To some degree, a chronology involving only the machine cut nail heads was possible, so the null hypothesis is rejected.  This is not a final answer and I am sure that more specific dates could be obtained from the nails with a more thorough study.</p>
               <h3>Building Type</h3>
               <p>
While the building location cannot be obtained, patterns are visible that can guide future excavations, so the null hypothesis is rejected.  Sections 3 and 4 have the strongest correlations, followed by Sections 5 and 2.  Further excavation is not recommended at Section 1, or farther west than Unit 14.</p>
               <p>
It seems likely that due to the high number of broken nails the building was salvaged, which affects the outcomes of the second and third hypotheses, so the null hypothesis is rejected.  This effect may be testable if the location of the building can be found although evidence that the foundation stones were also salvaged may make this difficult.</p>
               <p>
The isolated high numbers of Units 11 and 12 offer some interesting questions.  The possible reasons for this occurrence are too many to list but if these two units are researched carefully, involving all of the evidence, an answer might be reached that will provide more information about the salvaging activities, building type, and general site history.</p>
               <p>
In most archaeological studies, investigating these questions often leads to more questions and Beaver Crossing is no different.  Some of these questions require a more complete excavation of the site, while others are simply lacking in artifactual evidence to find an answer.  Hopefully, in the future more complete studies might be done to answer some of these questions.</p>
