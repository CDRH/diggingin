               <h1>Chapter 9<br/>
Container Glass</h1>
               <p>
Excavation at the Beaver Crossing Trail Site (25SW49) and historic documentation from the time period has determined that the area was a way station or fording site from circa 1862&#8211;1871.  The site is located on the Nebraska City Cut-off, a portion of the Oregon Trail, southwest of Grand Island.  During the 1840s, traffic along the trail became flooded with military personnel, immigrants, entrepreneurs, and religious groups, some of whom no doubt held sentiments and allegiances to the temperance and prohibition movements coming out of the East, which may have had an effect on the types and quantity of container glass present at the site.</p>
               <p>
Of all the artifacts excavated, I chose to analyze container glass.  My goal was to do an analytic study of the number and types of container glass found, and contrast that with drinking practices or alcoholic activity of the time.  Due to the fact that no whole vessels were found, I was forced to acquire my data according to side panel geometry and bottle base analysis.  My findings were surprising; the only shards that appeared to be identifiable were those belonging to bitters bottles.  Virtually no other bottles of the time had a square shape with camphered edges, except the occasional schnapps bottle.  This realization lead me to question why there was such a high density of bitters bottle glass, as opposed to the preferred drink of whiskey.  Being that the old 1830s notion that alcohol was necessary for health still resounded and that bitters contained medicinal alcohol, it became necessary that historical research in relation to alcohol on the Plains be added to this chapter.</p>
               <p>
Alcohol first became a problem for America during the Revolutionary War.  Coincidentally, war was the perfect setting for strong alcohols, such as rum, to prove their calming effects against the jitters and anxieties of battle.  Alcohol gave colonial troops the nerve to fight and win, but it also sent most men home as alcoholics.  The war, in retrospect, addicted the nation to the vices of hard alcohol.  Colonists had used rum from the Caribbean in limited quantities since the mid-seventeenth century.  Rum usually had strength of 100&#8211;200 proof or 50&#8211;100 percent alcohol content.  Although the temperance movement of the nineteenth century would denounce 'demon rum' the growing motto of most colonists was, &quot;the stronger, the better.&quot;  By the eighteenth century, people were affirmed in their love for hard liquor.</p>
               <p>
As settlement spread to the frontier, rum became too bulky and expensive to ship west.  As such, grain whiskey became the liquor of choice for many settlers.  Since grain was so plentiful on the Plains, whiskey came into wider consumption than rum (Lender and Martin 1987:42).  Soon, Maryland and Pennsylvania became national centers for rye whiskey.  Kentucky followed suit with major production of corn whiskey, and later, the popular alcoholic beverage bourbon in 1789.  As the colonial period drew to a close most Americans still held to the belief that drinking was a positive social and personal necessity, yet dissention was on the horizon.</p>
               <p>
In June of 1851, the governor of Maine signed into a bill banning the sale of alcohol for consumption in the state (Lender and Martin 1987:86).  The mayor of Portland, Maine, Neal Dow, who had devised this whole set of statutes, became known as the &quot;Father of the Maine Law.&quot;  He believed that the manufacture, sale, distribution, and use of alcohol, known collectively as &quot;the traffic,&quot; was an evil that had to be legally thwarted in the cause of protecting the well-being of all citizens.  By 1855, twelve additional states and two British colonies had enacted laws similar to those created by Neal Dow.  Although not the starting point of negative attitudes toward excessive alcohol consumption, the Maine laws were the first major legal action taken by the states regarding the issue.  However, with the coming of the Civil War, attention was drawn away from temperance towards slavery and the preservation of the Union.  Lender and Martin (1987:86) support this by stating that &quot;indeed, by the time the Confederate guns opened on Fort Sumter in April 1861, prohibition had all but collapsed as a major public issue.&quot;</p>
               <p>
Of the fourteen proveniences I chose to analyze, ten of them contained identifiable shards of glass resembling the square, camphered-edge style of bitters glass from the 1860-1870s.  A lot of bitters glass from this time was green, amber, or aqua.  The collection from Beaver Crossing has no aqua container glass but lots of green and amber colored bitters glass.  This was determined through bottle design analysis and the presence of a few distinguishable pieces such as a windowpane from Kelly's Old Cabin Bitters patented in 1863, 1865, and 1870 from proveniences 0141, 0140, and 0173.  Not to say that all glass found was from bitters bottles because I did identify whiskey bottle glass in proveniences 0162, 0182, 0191, one shard of which certainly belongs to the light blue violin flask pictured in <em>Early American Bottles and Flasks</em> by Stephen Van Rensselaer.  There was drinking on the frontier, but the degree to which people had to keep it private can only be predicated by looking at the amount of prohibition activity taking place on the Plains at this time.</p>
               <p>
Whiskey is what kept the ember of American annexation smoldering in the 1860s, and what hurried the dispatch of the North-West Mounted police to the western Plains to evict the American whiskey traders.  From Winnipeg to the Rockies, whiskey kept the Plains in a state of caution for fifty years.  Not only was it difficult to get whiskey from the east coast shipped to the frontier, unless you made it yourself; it was also difficult for settlers to handle the growing religious and temperance movements coming their way. According to James A. Gray (1972:2), &quot;for the deeply religious Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians who pioneered the settlement of the West, strong drink was more, much more, than a challenge.  Whiskey to the fundamentalist Protestants was what pork was to the Muslims and Jews, animal flesh to the Hindus, and coffee and tobacco were to Mormons.&quot;  These were the people who most combated the addiction of the settlers of the Western Plains and &quot;for sheer intensity of conviction and staying power no other prairie mass-movement ever equaled the Prohibition Crusade&quot; (Gray 1972:2).  As for prohibition's failure, it still unleashed the most law-abiding era in prairie history.  Now, this evidence sheds light on the bitters conundrum of Beaver Crossing.  It must be necessary for the people frequenting these fording sites to be cautious with their drinking behavior in view of the public eye.  A logical choice for many settlers was to make the public think that they didn't drink excessively.  Thus, they masked their addiction with the medicinal supplement, bitters.</p>
               <p>
The first American Temperance Society was not formed until 1826, but by 1830 more than 1000 temperance societies existed throughout the United States.  &quot;During the thirty years from 1830-1860, temperance organizations were gaining great strength and popularity in the rural communities.  More importantly, they were beginning to initiate statewide prohibitionary measures in Oregon, Michigan, Maine, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, all of which adopted prohibition measures of varying restrictive nature ranging from licensing to complete prohibition&quot; say Ewing and Rouse (1978).  The frontier was literally surrounded by opposition and law enforcement.  The ultimate goal of these reformers was not to change the sinner but just to take the drink away.  They labeled all who drank as moral degenerates.  The coordinated activity between these groups housed one inscription and goal as their banner sign, National Prohibition.  They would fight for the next seventy years trying to obtain it.  Ewing and Rouse (1978:48) state that &quot;because of this moral upswing, more churches became directly involved in the temperance movement. Catholics formed the Total Abstination Union in 1872.  Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians, already deeply involved, set up similar groups and their respective publishing houses printed extensively on the subject of alcohol and abstinence.&quot;  These organizations would only foster more strength for women and new laws in the future of which they would play an integral role.</p>
               <p>
&quot;Beginning in the 1850's, American case and statute law established alcohol policies that applied specifically to women, which aimed broadly to promote temperance among both sexes&quot; says Nicolaides (1996:1211).  There were two types of liquor laws enacted during the 1850s, one being the access laws and the other being the domestic laws. The access laws forbade women to purchase alcohol, patronize liquor outlets, and work in the alcohol trade. The main goal was to protect women from becoming alcoholics, yet the law had its drawbacks in that it depleted women's legal power. The second set of laws was deemed the domestic laws; these were designed to involve issues of marriage, divorce, and civil liability statutes.  This set of laws gave women the legal authority to protect their families from drunken family members, especially husbands, by any means necessary.  Yet a backfiring result was, &quot;as the ideal traits intermingled, so did the wretched traits of fallen women.&quot;  Thus, if a woman indulged in drink she was assumed to be unpure, ungodly, and promiscuous&quot; (Nicolaides 1996:1213).  The reality of the colonial period's more open nature to both sexes' consumption of alcohol drastically changed during the switch from a household-based economy to free-market capitalism. The result for many women, who traditionally through historic reference were not partakers of alcohol after the colonial era ended, was to drink in private or abstain.  This and other factors may be why we see so much bitters bottle glass at Beaver Crossing.  It is only logical, for fear of reputation degradation and law enforcement, that settlers didn't dispose of whiskey bottles in or around town.</p>
               <p>
Beaver Crossing, like many other sites of the time, probably existed under the weight of the temperance movement.  It wasn't until the Civil War that attention finally got diverted to something else.  The fact that the infrastructure of the time was poor, and that many small settlements like Beaver Crossing received news months after it actually happened leads me to believe that the trends of concealed alcohol consumption were well engrained in those societies.  To have bitters instead of whiskey on the shelves of your house or store was a safer bet to divert attention from yourself than to have the hated &quot;devil rum&quot; or grain whiskey in your cupboard.  I believe, although bitters was a medicine, it was merely used as a decoy.  Most whiskey bottles of the time were probably kept and refilled over and over again.  The addiction was hidden and kept secret at Beaver Crossing because so much traffic traveled through there, like religious groups bent on cleansing the United States of the vice of alcoholism.  When the site was salvaged and left, the empty bitters bottles were no longer needed to cover up the obvious.  Plus, the brief moment of silence during the Civil War only lasted up until 1862 when strict anti-drinking regulations for troops were ordered after a breakdown in morality and restraint broke out.  I am sure that the bitters bottles of the time served as an adequate medicine to some, but I believe bitters was used in a far more complex manner that that.  Bitters hid the truth from many a prohibitionist, and protected the choices of many settlers.</p>
