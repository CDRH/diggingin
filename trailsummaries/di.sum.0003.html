               <h1>The Ox-Bow Trail</h1>
               <p>
The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> has been declared one of the most significant and overlooked historic trails in Nebraska.  It received the name &quot;Ox-Bow&quot; due to its round about trip from <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska City</a> to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Fort Kearney</a>.  It was shaped like a wooden yoke that oxen used to pull wagons over the busy route (Saunders County Historical Society 1983:6).  However, the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> also has been known as the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">California Trail</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Old Freighters Trail</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Mormon Road</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Military Road</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Old Fort Kearney Road</a>, and the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Old Nebraska City Road</a>.</p>
               <p>
                   <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska City</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Rock Bluff</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Brownville</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Wyoming</a>, and <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Plattsmouth</a>, <a title="Place [ne]" class="abbr">NE</a> were some of the main jumping off points for the trail west.  The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> went northwest from these towns to the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Salt Creek]" class="geogname">Salt Creek</a> crossing near present day <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ashland</a>.  The crossing, known as <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Saline Ford</a>, was a natural phenomenon that allowed travelers to cross over a limestone bridge that lay inches under the water's surface.&#160; The limestone ford continues to be visible today.  From <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Saline Ford</a>, the trail followed the south bank of the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Platte River]" class="geogname">Platte River</a> southwest to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Fort Kearney</a>. The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> joined the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Oregon Trail</a> just outside of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">New Fort Kearney</a> (Saunders County Historical Society 1983:44&#8211;45).   Currently, the Saunders County Historical Society houses one of the Twin Rocks originally located northeast of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ceresco</a>.  These large rocks acted as guideposts to travelers on the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> (Allen 1992).</p>
               <p>
The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> received constant use by settlers, miners, freighters, and soldiers from about 1840 to 1867.  <a title="Place [or]" class="abbr">Oregon</a>-bound settlers started the trail by following Indian paths across the plains.  In the late 1840s and 50s, miners inundated the trail to find their fortunes in <a title="Place [ca]" class="abbr">California</a> and <a title="Place [co]" class="abbr">Colorado</a>.  During this time, many referred to the route as the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">California Trail</a>.  Some Mormons also used the trail to reach <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Salt Lake City</a>, <a title="Place [ut]" class="abbr">UT</a> from 1849&#8211;1864.  Due to a cholera outbreak at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Florence</a>, the principal way station for <a title="Place [ut]" class="abbr">Utah</a>-bound pioneers; the Latter Day Saint Church established a new starting station at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Wyoming</a>, <a title="Place [ne]" class="abbr">NE</a>.  The trail was also referred to as the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Mormon Road</a> (Saunders County Historical Society 1983:7).</p>
               <p>
While many utilized the trail, the overland freighting business dominated the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-bow trail</a> from 1852 to 1860.  The military freighting business boomed as more troops were stationed in the west to protect settlers from Indian uprisings.  Major freighting companies like <a title="Org [rmw]" class="orgname">Russell, Majors, and Waddell</a> first used the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-bow trail</a> or <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Old Fort Kearney Road</a> to carry supplies to western military posts and mining camps.  The trail received additional traffic when <a title="Org [rmw]" class="orgname">Russell, Majors, and Waddell</a> received a contract to ship thousands of wagon loads of freight over the trail to <a class="persName" title="Person [johnstona]">Johnston</a>'s army in <a title="Place [ut]" class="abbr">Utah</a> in 1858 and 1859 (Olson 1966:106).</p>
               <p>
The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska City-Ft. Kearney Cut-off</a> opened in 1861 shortening the original <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow</a> route by forty miles (Kimball 1988:142).  During the 1860s, the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> was often called the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Old Freighters Road</a>.  The overland freighting business reached its pinnacle in 1865 when more than 44 million pounds of goods were shipped west from <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska City</a>.  The major wagon freighting business came to an end with the completion of the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific Railroad</a> through <a title="Place [ne]" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  Consequently, the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ox-Bow Trail</a> was used primarily by local settlers after 1867 (Nebraska State Historical Society 2005).</p>
