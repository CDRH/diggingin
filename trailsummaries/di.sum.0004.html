The <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific Railroad</a> fostered the development of many western <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> towns.  In 1867, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> was nothing more than a section house and a water tower at the edge of the newly laid railway. <a href="#ndi.000403">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  In 1868, two brothers, <a class="persName" title="Person [lonergan]">the Lonergans</a>, came to the area as construction workers for the railroad and decided to stay and develop the town.  <a class="persName" title="Person [aufdengartenl]">Louis Aufdengarten</a> arrived with the <a title="Org [army]" class="orgname">U.S. Army</a> the same year and became <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>'s first merchant.  The three men helped lay the foundation for the future growth of the town.<a href="#ndi.000403">

	  </a>
               </p>
               <p>
Due to Texas fever quarantines in 1873 in <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Abilene</a>, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ellsworth</a>, and <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Wichita, Kansas</a>, new cattle trails were forged in the west.  In 1874, famous cattle drover, <a class="persName" title="Person [lytlej]">John Lytle</a>, forged the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Western Trail</a> from <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Bandera, Texas</a> to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Dodge City, Kansas</a>.<a href="#ndi.000403">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  By 1876, most <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle drives had abandoned the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Chisholm Trail</a> and adopted the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Western Trail</a> leading to more prolific markets in the northwest.<a href="#ndi.000403">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>
               </p>
               <p>
Dissatisfied with the <a title="Org [kp]" class="orgname">Kansas Pacific Railroad</a>, many <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle drovers looked to the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific</a> for less expensive rail shipment to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Chicago</a>.  While anxious for the increase in business, the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific</a> first had to establish the best shipping point on their line.  In 1870, after vying with <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Columbus</a>, the village of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Schuyler</a> became the first cow town in <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  However, settlers flooded into the <a title="GeogName(valley) [Blue Valley]" class="geogname">Blue Valley</a> the following year utilizing herd laws to press the cattle drovers out.  In 1871, the cattle trail moved further west to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kearney</a>.  As more settlers encroached on the plains of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>, the trail's end was ultimately moved west to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> in 1873.  <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> became known as the cowboy capital of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> for the next decade <a href="#ndi.000405">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>(187).</p>
               <p>
Several factors contributed to the extension of the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Western Trail</a> to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala, Nebraska</a>.  First of all, an influx of farmers and ranchers to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kansas</a> and <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> caused cattle driving to be pressed further west.  Various trespassing and quarantine laws were enacted to keep <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle out of the area.  <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> became a promising new cow town due to the stringent laws enacted in the east.<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  In addition, the town was located in an ideal spot for cattle shipping.  <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> was located at the edge of the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific</a> railway approximately 300 miles north of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Dodge City</a>. After the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Western Trail</a> was extended north to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>, it was commonly known as the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a>.<a href="#ndi.000405">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  In 1874, the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific</a> constructed cattle pens just west of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> to attempt to regain the former business enjoyed at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Schuyler</a> and <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kearney</a>. <a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>
               </p>
               <p>
Furthermore, high demand for cattle in northwestern <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> facilitated the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a>'s end to terminate at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>.  Many new cattlemen opened ranches near the cow town in order to get in on the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle boom.  <a class="persName" title="Person [bosler]">The Bosler Brothers</a>, notable cattle barons, purchased <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle in great abundance each year, as they were contracted to supply beef to the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Red Cloud</a> and <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Spotted Tail Indian</a> Agencies in northern <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  The success of the <a class="persName" title="Person [bosler]">Boslers</a> and others enticed many to start ranches along the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a>.</p>
               <p>
Military subduing of the Native Americans on the plains also influenced the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle business to take a more northwesterly route to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>.  In 1873, the <a title="Org [oga]" class="orgname">Ogallala</a> and <a title="Org [bru]" class="orgname">Brule Sioux</a> were removed from the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Platte River]" class="geogname">Platte River</a> to new agencies in northern <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  While the removal eliminated most of the depredations, some <a title="Org [sx]" class="orgname">Sioux</a> continued to molest cattlemen and settlers on the plains.  In 1876, <a class="persName" title="Person [crook]">General Crook</a> and <a class="persName" title="Person [miles]">Colonel Miles</a> led several military campaigns against the <a title="Org [sx]" class="orgname">Sioux</a>, strictly confining them to their reservation and allowing safe passage to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle drovers.<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>
               </p>
               <p>
The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle business boomed at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> in 1876.  Increased demand caused 75,000 to 125,000 cattle to be driven to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> each year until 1884<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>(92).  While the Indian agencies required approximately 25,000 head per season, the <a title="GeogName(hills) [Black Hills]" class="geogname">Black Hills</a> Gold Rush of '76 increased the demand for <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle in western <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>
                  <a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a> (94).</p>
               <p>
Approximately seventy-five thousand head of cattle were driven to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> in 1875 and increased to over 100,000 the next year<a href="#ndi.000405">
	 	[link] 
	  </a> (187).  The 1880 census showed the permanent population of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> to be 114 people.  However, from early spring until late fall, the Cowboy Capital hosted a multitude of cowhands, cattle barons, saloon operators, gamblers, dance hall girls, and tradesmen.  <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> has been labeled as a rough and tumble, wild-west town, perhaps due to the 17 violent deaths recorded during the cattle boom<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a> (97).</p>
               <p>
The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a> was not a clearly defined road.  It often spanned over twenty miles wide, running from the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Red River]" class="geogname">Red River</a> northward, with various branches, all ultimately leading to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>.<a href="#ndi.000402">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>  The <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Western Trail</a> started at <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Bandera, Texas</a> crossed the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Red River]" class="geogname">Red River</a>, then pushed on to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Dodge City</a>.  The trail angled north and west to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Buffalo Station</a> on the <a title="Org [kp]" class="orgname">Kansas Pacific Railroad</a>, about sixty miles west of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Hays</a> 
                  <a href="#ndi.000405">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>(188).   Prior to 1880, the main route of the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a> entered <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> fifty miles east of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Haigler</a>.  After 1880 eastern quarantines moved the trail further west, four miles east of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Haigler</a>.  This area was known as the <a title="GeogName(canyon) [Texas Trail Canyon]" class="geogname">Texas Trail Canyon</a> and became a checkpoint for incoming cattle in 1883.<a href="#ndi.000401">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>   Finding water was the foremost concern of the drovers while crossing northern <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kansas</a> and southwestern <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  Only a few major rivers provided stable water to the men and cattle, while smaller streams often dried up.  The last day's trip from <a title="GeogName(waterway) [Stinking Water Creek]" class="geogname">Stinking Water Creek</a> to the <a title="GeogName(waterway) [South Platte River]" class="geogname">South Platte</a> was the longest, driest stretch of the journey.  After reaching <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a>, cattle bosses and barons would agree on a price per head and the cattle were either shipped to various points along the <a title="Org [up]" class="orgname">Union Pacific</a>.<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a>
               </p>
               <p>
Several factors caused the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a> to fall into disuse.  The consolidation of ranches into large cattle companies in the early 1880s signaled the decline in the industry<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a> (106).  However, the most significant factors in the decline of the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle business were angry homesteaders and Texas fever quarantines.  After extremely abundant rainfall in western <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a> in the early 1880s, farmers pressed into the <a title="GeogName(valley) [Republican River Valley]" class="geogname">Republican River Valley</a> convinced of agricultural success.  The nesters, as settlers were often called by cattlemen, charged fees for cattle passage across their land or on occasion usurped fees for the release of trespassing cattle.  <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> drovers found it difficult and expensive to maneuver their cattle around the new &quot;nesters&quot; property<a href="#ndi.000404">
	 	[link] 
	  </a> (106).  In addition, <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kansas</a> legislature passed a law in 1884, moving the cattle quarantine line west of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Dodge City</a>.  The following year, the entire state of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Kansas</a> was closed to <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle from December to March.  Furthermore, a Texas fever outbreak in 1884 caused severe cattle losses in western <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  Several smaller ranchers blamed larger corporations like <a title="Org [RLC]" class="orgname">Rankin Live Stock Company</a> for shipping in the diseased cattle.  Ranchers fearing the loss of expensive blooded bulls that they had added to their herds demanded that <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas</a> cattle be quarantined from the state of <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Nebraska</a>.  The range cattle business sharply declined after 1884 due to the newly enacted laws.  A few more drives crossed the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Texas Trail</a> in the late 1880s, but never again to achieve the magnitude of the <a title="Place []" class="abbr">Ogallala</a> Cattle Boom days<a href="#ndi.000404">
